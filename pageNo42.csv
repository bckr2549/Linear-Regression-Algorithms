"In its January 2021 report, the World Bank had forecast global
economic output to expand by 4% in 2021 and moderate
to 3.8% in 2022. However, it expects recovery of global
economic output to remain below pre-pandemic trends for
a prolonged period. It attributes the slower growth to the
massive debt levels that have been accumulated over the
past decade and recent stimulus packages, which, while
creating liquidity, cause inflationary pressures, thereby
exposing the global economy to financial market stress. The
World Bank highlighted that downside risks could increase
if the spread of virus was not controlled or there was delay
in vaccine procurement and distribution. This could lead to
more severe and longer-lasting effects on potential output
and financial stress following from high debt levels and weak
growth. The bank stated that limiting the spread of the virus,
providing relief for vulnerable populations, and overcoming
vaccine-related challenges were the immediate priorities

"The nation-wide lockdown caused a sharp contraction
of 23.9% in GDP during Q1 FY 2021, recovering to a 7.5%
drop in Q2, together with improvement in all key economic
indicators. Commencing from July 2020, the recovery has
been V-shaped, as demonstrated by Quarter-on-Quarter GDP
growth, a sustained resurgence in high frequency indicators
such as power demand, E-way bills, GST collection, steel
consumption, and so on. GST collections, in fact, reached
pre-COVID monthly levels following unlocking of industrial
and commercial activity. Imports contracted more sharply
than exports and foreign exchange reserves were at levels covering 18 months of imports. Inflation, mainly driven by
food prices, remained above 6% for much of the year. India’s
GDP is estimated to contract by 7.7% in FY 2020-21, with a
sharp 15.7% decline in first half of the year and a minor 0.1%
fall in the second half. Government consumption, improving
private consumption and net exports have cushioned the
economy in the second half. If taken sector-wise, agriculture
can be said to have performed better in comparison to
industries, with a growth of 3.4% during FY 2020-21. Industry
and services are estimated to contract by 9.6% and 8.8%
respectively during FY 2020-21. Within industry, mining is
estimated to contract by 12.4%, manufacturing by 9.4% and
construction by 12.6%. The utilities sector has shown a sharp
recovery and is set to register a growth of 2.7% in FY 2020-21.
Within services, trade, hotels, transport and communication,
which together constitute one-third of overall services, are
estimated to contract by 21.4%. ",,Indian Economy: The Year in Review
"The Economic Survey projects India’s real GDP to grow
by 11% in 2021-22, provided normalisation of economic
activities continues and the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines
gathers traction. If this is supplemented with a supply-side
push from reforms, the easing of regulation, continued
infrastructural investments, recovery of pent-up demand,
increase in discretionary consumption, low-interest credit
disbursement and adequate liquidity, the Economic Survey
projects that the economy can overtake the pre-pandemic
levels of FY 2019-20 in another two years (Source: Economic
Survey 2020-21). However, these estimates are subject to any
adverse impact caused by the recent wave of the pandemic. ",,Indian Economy: The Year in Review
"Global tourism suffered its worst-ever year in 2020, with
international arrivals dropping by 74% according to the latest
data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization
(UNWTO). International arrivals at destinations worldwide
were a billion fewer in 2020 than in the previous year. This
was due to an unprecedented fall in demand caused by the
strict travel restrictions imposed by governments to curtail
the spread of the pandemic. International tourist arrivals
(overnight visitors) dropped by 87% in January 2021, amid
new outbreaks and tighter travel restrictions following a
decline of 85% in the quarter ended December 2020. In AsiaPacific, the count dropped by 96% since the region continues
to have the highest level of travel restrictions in place. Europe
and Africa both saw a decline of 85% in arrivals, while the
Middle East recorded a drop of 84%. International arrivals
in the Americas decreased by 77% in January 2021. (Source:

"Owing to a surge in COVID-19 cases and emergence of new
variants, many countries have reintroduced stricter travel
restrictions, mandatory testing, quarantines, and in some
cases, border closures and domestic lockdowns. This has
impacted the resumption of international travel. Further,
the pace of vaccinations has been slower than expected and
varies across countries. With 32% destinations worldwide with
complete border closure in early February, 2021 and another
34% with partial closure, UNWTO expects international
tourist arrivals to be down by 85% during January-March,
2021 over the same period in 2019, representing a loss of
about 260 million international arrivals.","Outlook",Industry Insight
"Most experts do not see global travel returning to prepandemic levels before 2023. Amongst all regions, Asia-Pacific
is likely to see the highest rebound of international tourism.
UNWTO’s extended scenarios for 2021-2024 indicate that it
could take 2 1/2-4 years for international tourism to return to
2019 levels. In one scenario projected by it, there could be a
rebound in September 2021, with 22% increase in international
arrivals. Another scenario sees a rebound in July 2021, with
international arrivals increasing by 66% for 2021 compared
to the historic lows of 2020. One optimistic scenario projects
arrivals at 55% below the pre-pandemic levels recorded in
2019. The scenarios consider several factors such as a gradual
improvement of the epidemiological situation, continued
rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, a significant improvement in
traveller confidence and a major lifting of travel restrictions,
particularly in Europe and the Americas.","Outlook",Industry Insight
